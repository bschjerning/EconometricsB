    "dependent variable has three discrete outcomes. We use the multinomial\n",
    "logit model to express the probability of individuals to be either\n",
    "outside the labour market, unemployed or employed. This model is a\n",
    "generalization of the logit model we looked at in Problem set 4 (binary\n",
    "choice) which only allowed for the dependent variable to have two\n",
    "discrete outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of two things for each $i$, $(y_i, \\mathbf{x}_i)$, \n",
    "where $y_i \\in \\{1,...,J\\}$, and $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is a $K\\times 1$ vector \n",
    "of explanatory variables relating to the individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the multinomial logit the probability of observing choice $j$ for\n",
    "household $i$ given the observed explanatory variables, $x_{i}$ is given\n",

    "\n",
    "The probabilities lie between 0 and 1 since\n",
    "$\\exp(x_{i}\\beta_j)>0$ and they sum to one over the\n",
    "$J$ alternatives. The expression,\n",
    "(1), can be derived from an underlying latent\n",
    "utility model, where taste shocks follow an extreme value type 1\n",
    "distribution. The data-generating process of this latent utility model\n",
    "can be formalized as\n",

    "\n",
    "where the utility, $u_{ij}$, consists of a deterministic part,\n",

    "$i$ chooses the alternative $y_i\\in \\{1,\\ldots,J\\}$ that is associated\n",

    "$j$ that has the highest utility. The challenge for the econometrician is \n",
    "that the error terms $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ are not in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, it can be shown that if one simulates data according to the \n",
    "Data Generating Process (DGP) above, then the choice probabilities in (1) \n",

    "That is, we cannot identify a parameter on a regressor, $\\beta_{kj}$, \n",
    "for all alternatives $j=1,...,J$. The argument why this is the case is \n",
    "presented in this youtube video: https://youtu.be/IeDJN6VQtLg. \n",
    "Intuitively, the argument boils down to the fact that we can only identify \n",
