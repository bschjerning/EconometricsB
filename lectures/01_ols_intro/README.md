## Linear Model and OLS in Cross Section
This lecture summarizes some of the properties of the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the linear model based on a cross section. Our focus is on asymptotics as the number of cross-sectional units (individuals, firms, or the like) grow without bound, viewing the dimension of the parameter space as small and fixed. (This is the classical point of view.) We develop arguments for identification of model parameters, establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the OLS estimator under suitable conditions, and discuss how one may consistently estimate its asymptotic variance matrix. Finally, we introduce the Wald test in the context of testing linear hypotheses concerning the model coefficients. This lecture serves a dual purpose in that it will act as both a refresher and a prelude to our discussion of linear models for panel data in lectures to follow.

**Readings:** Wooldridge (2010) Chapter 4: Sections 4.1--4.2.3.

*Note:* You should revisit your notes and/or references from both your fundamentals of probability and statistics course and previous econometrics course. We will presume knowledge of basic matrix algebra and the linear regression model in matrix form. Such topics are treated in, for example, the appendices of Wooldridge's "Introductory Econometrics - A Modern Approach." (Appendices B, C, D and E in my 2009 version of the book.)

**Video Supplement:** Part of the material from this lecture is discussed in a [video taped lecture on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVIj8KtYzJc&t=0s). You may find the video a useful supplement. The video may display YouTube ads.
