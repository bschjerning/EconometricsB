## Linear Panel Model and Methods: Fixed Effects and First Differences
In this lecture we introduce the classical linear unobserved effects model for panel data. We motivate the use of panel data as a method for circumventing an omitted variable problem and proceed to discuss two estimation methods in detail, namely the fixed-effects (FE) estimator and first-differences (FD) estimator. These estimators are shown to be consistent under an assumption of strictly exogenous regressors (conditional on the individual effect).

Readings: Wooldridge Chapter 10, Sections 10.1-3, 10.5.1-4, 10.6.1-3, 10.7.1 pp. 321-2 [stop at "If we maintain contemporaneous exogeneity (...)"] and p. 325 [from "If T=2, it is easy to test for strict exogeneity" through "An example is given in Problem 10.12."]. We will get back to Section 10.7.1 later, so you may also decide to read the whole section at this point.

Notes: Fixed effects and first differences are really just special cases of system LS (=least squares applied to a system of equations---here one for each time period). System LS and its variants is the topic of Wooldridge Chapter 7.
