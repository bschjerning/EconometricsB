## Linear Panel Model and Methods: Random Effect Methods and Hausman Test
We continue our discussion of approaches to identification and estimation of the linear unobserved effects model for panel data,  Specifically, this lecture covers the random effects (RE) approach to estimation of the classical linear unobserved effects panel data model. We discuss advantages and drawbacks of the RE approach when compared to the FE/D approaches and also device a formal test---known as the Hausman test---for comparing the RE and FE estimators.

**Readings:** Wooldridge Chapter 10: Sections 10.4.1-2, 10.7.2-3 [stop at "Equation (10.87) also suggests (...)" on p. 332].

**Note:** Random effects is really just a special case of system LS (=least squares applied to a system of equations---here one for each time period) for a particular weighting matrix. System LS and its variants is the topic of Wooldridge Chapter 7.
