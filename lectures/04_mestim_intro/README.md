## M-Estimation: Introduction and Non-Linear Least Squares
In this lecture we enter the world of non-linear parametric models and their associated estimation methods. We introduce the framework of M-estimation using non-linear regression and non-linear least squares (NLS) as a motivating example. In a non-linear modelling framework the true parameter can (typically) not be recovered in closed form. Instead identification is obtained by first framing the model parameter as a solution to a certain population minimization problem and then arguing uniqueness. We discuss the assumptions used for identifying in the context of non-linear regression. This lecture serves in part as a building block for the following lectures, where we take a closer look at the properties of M-estimators and methods for doing inference within this framework.

**Note:** Chapters 12 and 13 in Wooldridge are *quite abstract and technical*, and may be a tough first encounter. However, the results derived in these chapters will be tremendously helpful in later lectures. So if you find yourself a bit lost in the process, rest assured that your efforts will pay off at a later stage.

**Readings:** Wooldridge Chapter 12, Sections 12.1 and 12.2 up to and including Equation (12.11) on p. 402. (We'll discuss the rest of Section 12.2 in later lectures, so you may also choose to read the whole section at this point.)
